# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Hi mates, this is the shared folder which contains the files split by months.  [GOOGLE DRIVE LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1E4Rmw9ctI7xc4pgJd4ZnlZFx6p5vlHje)
