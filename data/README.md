# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Hi mates, this is the shared folder which contains the files split by months.  [GOOGLE DRIVE LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AP3j2TPjzugt7eGlh1fEGvLNBMuXF8fE?usp=sharing)
Please do not make any change to the "per.csv", otherwise the app may not behave properly.
