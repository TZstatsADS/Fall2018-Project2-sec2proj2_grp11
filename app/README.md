# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0
### App folder

The App directory contains the app files for the Shiny App (i.e., ui.r and server.r).

Using “subsetted_data.csv”, with NA lines deleted, a file called “per.csv” is produced by “pj2_year.R” in the “doc” folder. “per.csv” is the only data file used in the “app.r” (server & ui functions are both in “app.r”)
