# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

The pj2_year.R is used to process the raw data(subsetted_data.csv) into a file "per.csv" for app use. Both the csv files are in the "data" folder. For size issue, the zipped file of "subsetted_data.csv" is uploaded, but one can always download and unzip to check. However, the app.r in the "app" folder does not directly use "subsetted_data.csv" and only use the data in "per.csv".
